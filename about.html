  <h2>About Show-Me Psilocybin</h2>
  <p><strong>Show-Me Psilocybin</strong> is a grassroots effort to bring guided, therapeutic psilocybin treatment to the people of Missouri.</p>

  <p>We believe psilocybin is not a recreational substance — it’s a therapeutic compound that, under the guidance of trained professionals, can support healing from trauma, depression, addiction, PTSD, and end-of-life anxiety. Our vision is focused solely on <strong>clinical use in structured, counselor-supported environments</strong>.</p>

  <p><<h3>Why Missouri? Why Now?</h3>
<p>Missouri is a state full of strong communities, deep traditions, and people who look out for one another. But like the rest of the country, many Missourians are facing challenges when it comes to mental health — whether it's stress, trauma, depression, or anxiety. Our goal is to help the movement forward to provide safe and constructive therapy with the aid of psilocybin to the state of Missouri.</p>

<p>Psilocybin therapy offers a promising new path forward — one based in science, not politics. It's already being studied and used in other states and respected institutions. We believe Missourians deserve the same safe, guided access to these therapies, right here at home.</p>
/p>

  <p>Psilocybin therapy is already making a difference in places like Oregon, Colorado, and in clinical research institutions across the country. We believe Missouri deserves that same opportunity — not later, but now.</p>

  <h3>Who We Are</h3>
  <p>This movement began with a single Missourian — someone inspired not by profit or politics, but by a deep sense of duty to improve lives. Motivated by research, grounded in ethics, and fueled by compassion, that spark became Show-Me Psilocybin.</p>

  <p>We’re a small but growing team of Missourians — students, veterans, therapists, parents, professionals — united by the belief that healing should be available to those who need it, not criminalized.</p>

  <h3>Join Us</h3>
  <p>We are in the early stages of building Missouri’s first therapeutic psilocybin initiative. If you believe in expanding access to safe, evidence-based mental health care, we invite you to stay connected, get involved, and help shape what comes next.</p>
