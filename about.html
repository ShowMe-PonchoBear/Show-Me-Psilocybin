    <h2>About Show-Me Psilocybin</h2>
    <p><strong>Show-Me Psilocybin</strong> is a grassroots effort to bring guided, therapeutic psilocybin treatment to the people of Missouri.</p>

    <p>We believe psilocybin is not a recreational substance — it’s a therapeutic compound that, under the guidance of trained professionals, can support healing from trauma, depression, addiction, PTSD, and end-of-life anxiety. Our vision is focused solely on <strong>clinical use in structured, counselor-supported environments</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Who's The Founder of <strong>Show-Me Psilocybin?</strong></h3>
    <p>My name is Branson Rosand. I was natively born to the state of South Dakota in January of 2006. At age 8 I lost my mother Ashley Rosand to a car accident in Gregory SD. As an 8 year old, it changed my life forever. I went to live with my grandmother, and fight the battle of continuing on in my life without my parents. At 15 I went through more life changing events that ratified the way I see the world. I fell behind in my education, began to withdraw from friends and family, and came face to face with depression and ideation. At the age of 18 I received a once in a lifetime opportunity, to come to the State of Missouri and start fresh. In the city of Columbia I was surrounded and supported by my Family, Friends, and Academic colleagues. I completed my Highschool Diploma, and at 19 I began working on <strong>Show-Me Psilocybin</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Why Missouri? Why Now?</h3>
    <p>Missouri is a state full of strong communities, deep traditions, and people who look out for one another. But like the rest of the country, many Missourians are facing challenges when it comes to mental health — whether it's stress, trauma, depression, or anxiety. Our goal is to help the movement forward to provide safe and constructive therapy with the aid of psilocybin to the state of Missouri. I believe that everyone should deserve the opportunity to feel whole, accepted, and <strong>Welcome</strong>, to take part in building this world we are living in.</p>

    <p>Psilocybin therapy offers a promising new path forward — one based in science, not politics. It's already being studied and used in other states and respected institutions. We believe Missourians deserve the same safe, guided access to these therapies, right here at home. There is clinical evidence to support the claims that Psilocybin has many beneficial outcomes. Research studies from places such as Johns Hopkins, MAPS, Yale, and UCSF are signs of a new possibility. You can read more about these studies and the pertaining clinics and trials <a href="education.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Psilocybin therapy is already making a difference in places like Oregon, Colorado, and in clinical research institutions across the country. We believe Missouri deserves that same opportunity — not later, but now.</p>

    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>This movement began with a single Missourian — someone inspired not by profit or politics, but by a deep sense of duty to improve lives. Motivated by research, grounded in ethics, and fueled by compassion, that spark became Show-Me Psilocybin. We are consistently on the lookout for supporters to <strong>Show-Me Psilocybin’s</strong> cause. If you would like to learn more on how you can support <strong>Show-Me Psilocybin</strong>, you can find more details on our <a href="initiative.html">Initiative Page</a>.</p>

    <p>We’re a small but growing team of Missourians — students, veterans, therapists, parents, professionals — united by the belief that healing should be available to those who need it, not criminalized. The clinical evidence backing the benefits of Psilocybin are irrefutable.</p>

    <h3>Join Us</h3>
    <p>We are in the early stages of building Missouri’s first therapeutic psilocybin initiative. If you believe in expanding access to safe, evidence-based mental health care, we invite you to stay connected, get involved, and help shape what comes next. We encourage anyone with questions to visit our <a href="faqs.html">FAQ Page</a>. Join Us, <strong>Show-Me Psilocybin!</strong></p>
