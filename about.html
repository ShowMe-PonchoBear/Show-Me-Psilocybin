  <h2>About Show-Me Psilocybin</h2>
  <p><strong>Show-Me Psilocybin</strong> is a grassroots effort to bring guided, therapeutic psilocybin treatment to the people of Missouri.</p>

  <p>We believe psilocybin is not a recreational substance — it’s a therapeutic compound that, under the guidance of trained professionals, can support healing from trauma, depression, addiction, PTSD, and end-of-life anxiety. Our vision is focused solely on <strong>clinical use in structured, counselor-supported environments</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Why Missouri? Why Now?</h3>
  <p>Our state has long struggled with access to quality mental health care. From veterans coping with PTSD to families battling generational trauma, Missourians deserve more treatment options — especially those backed by science.</p>

  <p>Psilocybin therapy is already making a difference in places like Oregon, Colorado, and in clinical research institutions across the country. We believe Missouri deserves that same opportunity — not later, but now.</p>

  <h3>Who We Are</h3>
  <p>This movement began with a single Missourian — someone inspired not by profit or politics, but by a deep sense of duty to improve lives. Motivated by research, grounded in ethics, and fueled by compassion, that spark became Show-Me Psilocybin.</p>

  <p>We’re a small but growing team of Missourians — students, veterans, therapists, parents, professionals — united by the belief that healing should be available to those who need it, not criminalized.</p>

  <h3>Join Us</h3>
  <p>We are in the early stages of building Missouri’s first therapeutic psilocybin initiative. If you believe in expanding access to safe, evidence-based mental health care, we invite you to stay connected, get involved, and help shape what comes next.</p>
